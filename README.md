Adding the whole repositiry that I worked from is difficlt as most of my work was done in an isolated VM that has been mutating malware files.
Since that makes exporting the entire repo difficult I copied the files in gym-malware that I changed to this repo.
Every other file in gym_malware remained untouched.
ALl work was in these 2 files.
The files include my training file and sample_hashes.csv
sample_hashes.csv is a file containing the sha256 of each malwre sample and its malware family.
